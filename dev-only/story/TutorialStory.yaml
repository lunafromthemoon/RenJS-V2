  - deuzi says: Hello, are you the new student?
  - deuzi says happy: Welcome to our Tutorial Game!
  - deuzi says: My name is Deuzilene and I'll be your guide.
  - deuzi says normal: So you want to make a Visual Novel?
  - deuzi says: With RenJS you can easily make games just like this one.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is inspired by Ren'Py and based on PhaserJS.
  - deuzi says: If you are familiar with any of those you have an advantage.
  - deuzi says: And if not...
  - deuzi says happy: No problem!
  - deuzi says: RenJS is made so the text of your story is written intuitively like a movie script.
  - deuzi says normal: Once you learn the structure, there's no limit to what you can create.
  - deuzi says: Let's get inside and start right away.

    title: Chapter 1
    subtitle: The basics 
  - deuzi says: First things first, let's see what we need to start.
  - deuzi says: RenJS doesn't come or is tied to any particular IDE (integrated development environment).
  - deuzi says: That is, a program to read and edit the files of the game, like your story script.
  - deuzi says: It doesn't have to be anything big or expensive.
  - deuzi says happy: It can be any low level text processor you already have installed.
  - deuzi says normal: Another thing you will need is RenJS itself.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is the library that will manage the flow, assets and interactivity of your game.
  - deuzi says: And finally, you will need your game script, in a way that the library can understand.
  - deuzi says: To make things easy, RenJS comes with a Quickstart.
  - deuzi says: A Quickstar is a minimal game already set up for you to test and even use as a base for your games.
  - deuzi says: You can find a link to download it in this same page.
  - deuzi says: The game files will include the RenJS library, and the story script, configuration and assets.
  - deuzi says: So, have you downloaded it yet?
  - choice:
    - I have it!:
      - deuzi says happy: Great! What a hardworking student!
    - Not yet:
      - show deuzi: angry
      - deuzi says angry: What are you waiting for!?
      - deuzi says normal: Go do it, I'll wait...
      - choice:
        - I have it!:
          - deuzi says happy: Good! Let's continue.
  - deuzi says normal: Now, open the root directory of the Quickstart.
  - deuzi says: It should look like this.
  - show deuzi: AT LEFT WITH MOVE CONTINUE
  - show folders: AT 550,300 WITH FADE
  - deuzi says: There are four folders and two files.
  - deuzi says: RenJS is web based, that means the game runs as a webpage.
  - deuzi says: You can then embed the game in any other webpage, or package it as a mobile or desktop app.
  - deuzi says: Webpages are HTML files, and index.html is the page that contains the game.
  - deuzi says: To play and test the game locally, you need to open it as a webpage too.
  - deuzi says: What does it mean? 
  - deuzi says: It means you need a local server to deliver your page, as if it was published in the internet.
  - deuzi says: This sounds complicated, but it can be done easily with the right tools.
  - deuzi says: The easiest way is to use and IDE that lets you both edit your files, and publish them locally.
  - deuzi says happy: My personal recommendation is Brackets! This editor is free and open source. 
  - deuzi says happy: And allows you to do all you need to write games with RenJS.
  - deuzi says: You can also find a link to download it down there.
  - deuzi says: So, your second challenge is now to run the Quickstart locally.
  - deuzi says: Did you manage to do it?
  - choice:
    - Of course!:
      - deuzi says happy: Perfect! Then we can continue with the class.
    - It's too hard:
      - deuzi says happy: Don't worry, starting is always hard, but you'll get there.
      - deuzi says: You will find below a link to a video on how to run the Quickstart step by step.
      - deuzi says: If you still have troubles after that...
      - deuzi says: RenJS has a growing community of writer and developers that can help you.
      - deuzi says: You will find below also links to the RenJS forums and an invitation to the discord channel.
      - deuzi says: Make sure you can run the Quickstart, and then come back and we'll continue with the class.

  - deuzi says happy: Ok, let's continue.
  - deuzi says: Let's explore what's in each directory.
  - deuzi says: RenJS contains the library, renjs.js, and another file, boot.js that takes care of starting the game.
  - deuzi says: And the plugins directory contains plugin scripts for RenJS.
  - deuzi says: If you're making a simple game, you shouldn't worry about any of this.
  - deuzi says: The files that concern you as a writer are inside the story and assets directory.
  - deuzi says: The assets directory contains the images and sounds that make up the game.
  - deuzi says: Among this images you will find the backgrounds and characters of the story, but also the Graphical User Interface (GUI) assets.
  - deuzi says: Going back to the main directories, the last one is called story.
  - deuzi says: If you take a look, you will find three files with the extension yaml.
  - deuzi says: These YAML files are what you will use to make your game.
  - deuzi says: YAML is a human readable data serialization language.
  - deuzi says: That means that the files contain data in a structure that you and most humans can read and write easily.
  - deuzi says: In any case, the most important thing about YAML files is...
  - deuzi says angry: Indentation is super important! If you screw up the indentation the game won't even load!
  - deuzi says: If you're wondering what's indentation, I'll tell you.
  - deuzi says: It's the amount of whitespaces from the start of the line on a given line of text.
  - deuzi says: Go ahead and take a look at Setup.yaml
  - deuzi says: Everything is perfectly indented, each logical level adding further whitespaces.
  - deuzi says angry: So be very careful about it. Only two spaces per level!
  - hide folders: WITH FADE CONTINUE
  - show deuzi: AT CENTER WITH MOVE
  - deuzi says normal: Ok, that was a lot of information, don't you think?

      - deuzi says: I knew it!
      - deuzi says: I have a feeling you're not stopping until you write your first story.
      - deuzi says: Isn't that exciting?
  - show deuzi: normal

  - jair says: So you're the new student.
  - jair says: I've heard a lot about you from Deuzi.
  - jair says: She gets easily excited.
  - jair says angry: But with me, you'll have to prove yourself first.
  - jair says: Do you have what it takes to be a visual novel writer?
  - jair says normal: We'll see.
  - jair says: I'm Jair, btw.
  - jair says: But you should know that, since my name is on display right above the text box.
  - jair says: I'm here to show you how to setup your story.
  - effect SHOWTITLE: 
    title: Chapter 2
    subtitle: Setting up the story
  - jair says: All the setup is contained in the Setup.yaml file.
  - jair says: What this means is...
  - jair says: All your characters, music, sfx and everything else you're planning to use on the story,
  - jair says: needs to be declared on this file.
  - jair says: That means you need to know everything before even start to write your story.
  - jair says: What kind of writer doesn't though...
  - wait: 300
  - jair says happy: Just joking!
  - jair says: You won't always know what things you need for a story.
  - jair says: So every time you add something, remember to also add it to the setup file.
  - show jair: normal
  - jair says: As Deuzi already said, we'll be using the Quickstart as a base.
  - jair says: But this game comes with the bare minimal.
  - jair says: One background and one characters, Deuzilene herself.
  - jair says: That would make a poor example, so let's learn by doing.
  - jair says: And for that, we will need more assets. Luckily, we have something on hand for that.
  - jair says: You'll find a link below to download the Tutorial Assets Pack.
  - jair says: Download this asset pack and extract it inside the assets directory.
  - jair says: The assets themselves are inside their own directory, tutorial_assets_pack.
  - jair says: So what is this asset pack?
  - jair says: Exactly what it says on the tin. The assets used on this tutorial game.
  - jair says: Can you find me among the files?
  - choice:
    - I found some other characters, who are they?:
      - jair says angry: You just barely started today, you'll meet them when it's due.
    - Yes, I found you!:
      - jair says happy: I'm so handsome.
  - jair says normal: Anyway... Let's continue with the class.
  - show jair: AT RIGHT WITH MOVE CONTINUE
  - show setupbg: AT 400,350 WITH FADE
  - jair says: This is the Setup.yaml file. You should open it yourself, too.
  - jair says: The setup file is organized by type of game element.
  - jair says: The backgrounds with the backgrounds the characters with the characters.
  - jair says: Each type of element is declared in their own special way. 
  - jair says: But the main thing here is to keep everything tidy.
  - jair says happy: I bet Deuzi already told you all about indentation.
  - jair says normal: I like to tease her about this obsesion of hers...
  - jair says angry: But she's right, it's really important.
  - jair says normal: To put this in practice, let's add a new background.
  - jair says: First, locate the 'background' tag. It should be easy, it's in the first line.
  - jair says: You'll notice that the sole background declared here is indented by two spaces.
  - jair says: You have to keep this structure.
  - jair says: Each background has a tag, the name that will be used to refer to that background on the story.
  - jair says: And the path to where the background image is located.
  - jair says: If you go to the game's assets folder, you'll find all the images we can use here.
  - jair says happy: Seems like we have an afternoon background.

  - jair says: Your student is smart enought to get it without my help.
  - deuzi says: What? Do you agree with that?
  - choice:
    - Yeah, I checked the file by myself:
      - deuzi says normal: Alright, I guess you can continue with more advanced lessons then...
      - jair says happy: See, told you not to treat 'em like a baby.
      - deuzi says angry: Shut up, you! We'll have a talk later.
      - hide jair: WITH FADE
      - deuzi says normal: Ok, the next lesson starts soon, maybe you should save and rest before moving on.
      - deuzi says: It's going to be long, but it'll probably be easy for you.

  - jair says: The characters are... you know what a character is, come on.
  - show setupch: AT 400,300 WITH FADE
  - jair says: Ok so, inside the characters tag, each character is declared after its own tag.
  - jair says: Same as the backgrounds, this tag will be used to refer to this character on the text of your story.
  - jair says: Every time you need to use Deuzilene, you will use her tag, deuzi.
  - jair says: Characters also have a display name, that's the name that will apear on the name box when we talk.
  - jair says: The display name can have whitespaces, accents and whatever you want.
  - jair says: If you omit it, the tag will be used as the name.
  - jair says: The speech colour is the colour to write the name in the name box.
  - jair says: And then you have a list of looks.
  - jair says: A look is an image representing a state of the character.
  - jair says: You always need a normal look, that will be the default.
  - jair says: And you can have as many additional looks as you want.
  - jair says: Deuzi here can be happy or angry.
  - jair says happy: Her range of emotions is infinite though.
  - jair says normal: Believe me.
  - hide setupch:

  - jair says angry: It should have a better name, I know.
  - jair says: But for now, it's what we have.
  - jair says normal: Same as always, you have the cgs tag, and then each cgs has a tag and an image file.

  - show setupaudio: AT 400,350
  - jair says: You can have music, and you can have sfx.
  - jair says: The music will usually be looped, while the sfx will play just once.

  - liz says: Here we'll see how to actually write the story.
  - liz says happy: Are you ready!?
  - effect SHOWTITLE: 
    title: Chapter 3
    subtitle: Writing Part 1
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: First thing you need to know about a story is, it's divided in scenes.
  - liz says: Each scene is a list of orders that will be executed from first to last.
  - liz says: Inside a scene you can show backgrounds, characters, make them talk, show choices, call other scenes, and a lot more.
  - liz says: The scenes are all contained in the file YourStory.yaml.
  - liz says: And each one has a tag name. This name can be anything, but you always need a scene called start.
  - liz says: That will be, of course, the starting scene.
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Really easy, don't you think?
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: So, let's see what's the content of a scene.
  - show liz: AT RIGHT WITH MOVE
  - show scenestart:
  - liz says: This is the starting scene of this game.
  - liz says: First thing we do is play music.
  - liz says: Notice the dash symbol.
  - liz says: That dash indicates that this is a single action.
  - liz says: Every action starts with a dash.
  - liz says: Also, after declaring the basic action, you add a colon.
  - liz says: After this, you can add additional parameters.
  - liz says: But sometimes you don't need anything else, like in this case.
  - liz says: Still, the colon is important.
  - liz says: Next line we have another action, notice the starting dash.
  - liz says: This one shows the background whose tag is 'school_morning'.
  - liz says: You were there this morning, remember?
  - liz says: The background takes some aditional parameters.
  - liz says: The uppercase text WITH is a special word to indicate a transition.
  - liz says: And 'FADE' is the name of that transition.
  - liz says: There are a few transitions included with RenJS, like 'CUT', 'FADE', 'FUSION', 'MOVE', 'FADETOBLACK' and 'FADETOWHITE'.
  - liz says: You can add your own transitions if you feel adventurous.
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Or you can ask your programmer friend to code them for you!
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: The transitions aren't just for backgrounds but also for characters and cgs.
  - liz says: The next line shows a character appearing on the screen.
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Deuzilene, my best friend!
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: The first aditional parameter is her look. She was happy to welcome you!
  - liz says: Also, notice another special word AT, used to designate the position.
  - liz says: The position can be 'LEFT', 'CENTER', 'RIGHT', or it can be a coordinate like '200,200'.
  - liz says: And we use, too, the transition 'FADE'.
  - liz says: Next line is Deuzi welcoming you. The extra parameter is the text.
  - hide scenestart:
  - liz says: So, with just these sentences you can show backgrounds, characters and make them talk.
  - liz says: But how do we hide them?
  - liz says: Easily! Just hide them!
  - show scenehide:
  - liz says: In this scene Jair is trying to annoy Deuzilene once again.
  - show liz: angry
  - liz says: He has her phone!
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: On the second line, the phone, a cgs with 'phone1' tag, is shown.
  - liz says: As the cgs are smaller than characters, we need a specific coordinate to locate them on the screen.
  - liz says: We use the special word AT again, but this time, with the coordinates.
  - liz says: Next we play the phone's ringtone, an SFX tagged as 'ringtoneSFX'.
  - liz says: To visually show the phone is ringing, we show its onomatopoeia.
  - liz says: "As no character is speaking, the 'text' action is used instead."
  - liz says: Then Deuzilene comes to rescue her phone!
  - liz says: Can you notice something different when Deuzi appears this time?
  - liz says: That's right, she's flipped.
  - liz says: Sometimes we need our characters to face the other way.
  - liz says: One easy way to do it is to flip their look.
  - liz says: On the show action, you just add a new extra parameter.
  - liz says: "The line right after 'show' doesn't start with a dash, that means it's still the same action as before."
  - liz says: "And so we add the parameter, flipped: true."
  - liz says: Then Deuzi grabs her phone.
  - liz says: Hiding it is really easy, as I said before.
  - liz says: And same thing for characters, we can hide Deuzi, taking a specific transition.
  - liz says: Let's hide this lesson now.

  - liz says: "'SHAKE', a screen shake!"
  - liz says: "'SHOWTITLE', a title screen like the ones at the start of each chapter."
  - liz says: You can send two extra parameters, such as title and subtitle to it.
  - liz says: "'EXPLOSION', just what it says on the tin."
  - liz says: And the same goes for 'ATTACK', 'MULTIATTACK' and 'CHAINATTACK'.
  - liz says: One last thing.
  - liz says: The extra sounds and images used by ambients and effects have to be declared on the 'extra' section of the setup file.
  - liz says: For example, the RAIN ambient uses a rain sound and a raindrop image and you can use your own.

  - liz says: Today we're going to see a very important part of writting interactive fiction.
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Interactivity!
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: That is, how to let your players make choices that affect the story.
  - liz says: The most straightforward way of doing this is presenting a list of choices for the player to make.
  - liz says: Have you seen something like that in this game?
  - choice:
    - Yes, Deuzi asks a lot of questions:
      - show liz: happy
      - liz says: She does!
    - I don't think so:
      - show liz: angry
      - liz says: Was your head in the clouds? There were choices all over this lessons.
      - liz says: This just now was a list of choices and you clicked on one.
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: "Let's see an example:"
  - show lessonChoice:
  - liz says: This part of the story is really recent.
  - liz says: I asked you something.
  - liz says: And you could have choosen between two different options.
  - liz says: That is achieved with the action 'choice'.
  - liz says: This action then takes a list of choices, indented by two spaces, and starting each with a dash.
  - liz says: Your choices here were 'Yes, Deuzi asks a lot of questions' and 'I don't think so'.
  - liz says: Inside each option, indented too by two spaces from the choice text, there's a new list.
  - liz says: Those are the actions to execute if that choice is made.
  - liz says: And when those actions are finished, you return to the next action after the 'choice' tag.
  - hide lessonChoice:
  - liz says: Inside a choice you can do anything you do in a scene.
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Even showing more choices!
  - liz says: But that could get out of hand really fast. Try not to nest more than two choices at a time.
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: You learnt yesterday what a scene is, and now I'm going to show you how to change from one scene to the next.
  - show lessonScene:
  - liz says: This example shows a whole scene that can continue in two possible different scenes.
  - liz says: To start another scene we use the action 'scene'. It takes an extra parameter, the name of the scene to be executed next.
  - liz says: That means the order you write the scenes or place them in the file has nothing to do with the actual execution.
  - liz says: And that also means that you have to explicitly call the next scene when the current one ends.
  - liz says: We can see here that the game will continue in different paths depending on what choices the player makes.
  - liz says: When you change the scene, nothing else from that scene is executed.
  - liz says: So if the player picks the phone up and then chooses to go to the party, the scene will change immediately to the 'partyScene' scene. 
  - liz says: And if she doesn't attend the call or chooses not to go, the scene will continue until the end and change to the 'dormsScene' scene.
  - hide lessonScene:
  - show liz: happy
  - liz says: Remember you can always say no to invitations, don't fall for peer pressure.
  - show liz: normal
  - liz says: There's another way of making a choice.
  - liz says: Visual choices.
  - liz says: With visual choices instead of using a text line, each option is an image you have to click.
  - liz says: Let's see it in action.
  - visualchoice:
    - phone1 AT 620,300:

  - marco says: Now I can tell you.

  - effect SHOWTITLE: 
    title: Chapter 5
    subtitle: Story Flux
  - show marco: normal
  - marco says: This is chapter 5 of the course, that means you already know about choices and interrupts.
  - marco says: That's one way of changing the course of your story.
  - marco says: But some of our actions take a long time before they reflect on the outcome of our story.
  - marco says: That means that sometimes during the story you will need to keep record of the player's decisions.
  - marco says: What and how, exactly, is up to you.
  - marco says: RenJS allows you to save information with the action 'var'.
  - marco says: It's name comes from the word variable, since it's value could change.
  - marco says: Let's see an example of what you can do with this action.
  - show marco: AT RIGHT WITH MOVE
  - show lessonVarsNumeric:
  - marco says: Let's start with the easiest of the variable types, numbers. 
  - marco says: This kind of action is often called an assignation.
  - marco says: It assigns a value to a variable.
  - marco says: "We can say an assignation has two parts: left and right."
  - marco says: In our case, the parts are separated by a colon.
  - marco says: The left part contains the variable name.
  - marco says: And the right part contains the value that will be assigned.
  - marco says: This value can be the raw data, a number like 0.
  - marco says: Or we make an operation combining numbers and other variables in an operation.
  - marco says: To use the value of a variable in the right part, we have to surround its name with curly braces.
  - marco says: That way we are saying we need to go and find the value of those variables, replace them in the operation.
  - marco says: And then resolve the operation.
  - marco says: The first variable 'score' is assigned the number 0 directly.
  - marco says: Same with the variable 'extraPoints'.
  - marco says: The third line assigns again a value to the variable 'score'.
  - marco says: The old value is lost, and the new one will replace it.
  - marco says: The new value is a summatory between the old value and 10.
  - marco says: "First it evaluates the value of 'score' and then it resolves: 0 + 10 = 10"
  - marco says: In this way, we can make almost any arithmetical operation we want.
  - marco says: "The marks allowed in this operations are:"
  - marco says: " '+' is used for addition."
  - marco says: " '-' is for subtraction."
  - marco says: " '*' is for multiplication."
  - marco says: " '/' is for division."
  - marco says: And you can also use parentheses to make more complicated operations, like assigning something to 'totalScore'.
  - marco says: One last thing to pay attention to is...
  - marco says: Most of the values on the right side are bewtween inverted commas.
  - marco says: That's because the parser, the program that reads each line and decides what it means...
  - marco says: "gets nervous when special characters like + & / etc appear on a line."
  - marco says: So you have to use the inverted commas to let it know it's all one valid line.
  - hide lessonVarsNumeric:
  - marco says: Next type of variables are boolean.
  - marco says: A boolean variable can take only one of two values, either true or false.
  - marco says: These variables are useful to store flags of events.
  - show lessonVarsBoolean:
  - marco says: As with numeric variables, we can also assign an operations to the variables.
  - marco says: The operations in this case are logical, and they have their own symbols to use.
  - marco says: "The usual ones are:"
  - marco says: "'!', wich means 'not'. On the second line we assign the variable 'lightOff' with 'not lightOn'."
  - marco says: " '&&' means 'and'. The variable 'allLightsOn' will be true only if both variables 'lightOn and lampOn' are true."
  - marco says: " '||' means 'or'. The variable 'canRead' will be true if any of the variables 'lightOn or lampOn' are true."
  - marco says: With just these symbols, including parentheses too, you can create really complex operations.
  - hide lessonVarsBoolean:
  - show marco: happy
  - marco says: But there's yet another way to get a boolean value. One that mixes numbers with arithmetic!
  - marco says: Isn't it great!?
  - show marco: normal
  - show lessonVarsBooleanCont:
  - marco says: Here we have some new symbols.
  - marco says: "'>' greater than and '>=' greater or equal than."
  - marco says: "'==' equal to."
  - marco says: "'<' less than and '<=' less than or equal to."
  - marco says: We use those symbols to compare numbers and or variables that contain numbers.
  - marco says: So we can resolve that a 'highScore' means the 'score is greater than 10'.
  - marco says: A 'perfectScore' is when 'score is equal to maxScore'. 
  - marco says: And a 'lowScore' is when 'score is less than or equal to maxScore divided by two'.
  - hide lessonVarsBooleanCont:
  - marco says: The boolean operations are really important for the story, as you can use them to branch it. 
  - marco says: There's a last type of variable. This one is really easy.
  - show lessonVarsString:
  - marco says: This is a character string, or more directly, a string.
  - marco says: These variables store text.
  - marco says: You can store text directly, or combine them with more text.
  - marco says: The 'wholeName' variable will resolve to 'Mr. Marco Da Silva'.
  - show marco: happy
  - marco says: That's me!
  - show marco: normal
  - marco says: You can also show the content of any variable, not just strings, in any dialogue and text.
  - hide lessonVarsString:
  - show marco: happy
  - marco says: And those are all the types of variables you need.
  - marco says: Now we're going to see how we can use them to change the course of the story.
  - show marco: normal
  - marco says: For this we're going to use a new action, 'if'.
  - marco says: This action allows you to execute orders only if a condition is met.
  - show lessonIf:
  - marco says: As you can see, after the 'if', the condition is bewtween parentheses.
  - marco says: A condition is nothing more than a boolean value. Anything that evaluates to true or false.
  - marco says: So if you have a boolean variable like 'lightOn', we can use it as a condition.
  - marco says: If that condition is true, the actions indented inside the if are executed.
  - marco says: After an 'if' action, we can have an 'else' action.
  - marco says: This action is only to indicate what actions should be executed if the condition is false.
  - marco says: The else can be omitted, but if you need it, it should be immediately after the actions of the 'if'.
  - hide lessonIf:
  - show marco: happy
  - marco says: Let's see something a bit more complex.
  - show marco: normal
  - show lessonIfCont:
  - marco says: On this example we can see the condition as a logical operation. 
  - marco says: If that condition is met, we encounter a second 'if'.
  - marco says: This is another operation, but the variables being compared are strings, not numbers.
  - marco says: With strings, we use the '==' operator to check if they're equal.
  - marco says: You can use the other operators too, but they're not so useful.
  - marco says: Finally, we find an else, and here, we have to pay extra attention to the indentation.
  - marco says: The else is just next to the second 'if', but it's on the same level of the first one.
  - marco says: To which one do you think it belongs?
  - choice:
    - First 'if'!:
      - show marco: happy
      - marco says: Correct!
    - Second 'if?:
      - show marco: worry
      - marco says: Not really.
  - show marco: normal  
  - marco says: The indentation level is what marks the right 'if' to pair it with. So that 'else' belongs to the first 'if'.
  - hide lessonIfCont:
  - show marco: normal AT CENTER WITH MOVE
  - marco says: So that was all you need to know about logic and internal decisions in a story.
  - marco says: The pieces are simple enough, but combine them and you can make really intricate systems.
  - show marco: happy
  - marco says: I love systems!
  - marco says: They're so perfect!

    subtitle: Graphical User Interface
  - deuzi says: So, a Graphical User Interface, or GUI, constitutes most of the look and feel of your story.
  - deuzi says: The graphical elements of your story are the backgrounds, the characters and the cgs.
  - deuzi says: We could say that anything else is part of the GUI.
  - deuzi says: So, the menus, the text box where we show dialogue, the font of the texts, the buttons of the quick menu here in the corner.
  - deuzi says: All of that is part of the GUI.
  - deuzi says: The GUI is not exactly part of the story, but it's great to set the mood, to show the story's aesthetic.
  - deuzi says: So a period drama and a cyberpunk story shouldn't look the same.
  - deuzi says: Also, the GUI will depend on the image resolution used.
  - deuzi says: A little pixel art game will need a specific GUI, and so would a big HD one.
  - deuzi says: With RenJS we have an easy way to make the GUI look exactly the way we need.
  - deuzi says: Configuring of the GUI happens inside the file 'GUI.yaml'.
  - show deuzi: happy AT RIGHT WITH MOVE
  - deuzi says: Let's check it!
  - show lessonGUI:
  - deuzi says: The first tag we use is simpleGUI.
  - deuzi says: Inside it, the first tag is assets.
  - deuzi says: Just as we did with the story setup, here we need to declare each resource with a file and tag.
  - deuzi says: First of all, we have a fonts list.
  - deuzi says: For this GUI we only use one font, called auditmat-mono.
  - deuzi says: Fonts are declared in a special way.
  - deuzi says: To find them, we first have to load them in a web style.
  - deuzi says: Let's check for a moment the index.html file.
  - show lessonGUIFonts:
  - deuzi says: Here we tell the web page we need a 'font-face'.
  - deuzi says: The 'font-family' property is the name we'll be referencing in our GUI file.
  - deuzi says: And the 'src' indicates where to find the font file.
  - deuzi says: "We have our font file inside the 'assets/gui' folder."
  - deuzi says: You can go check!
  - hide lessonGUIFonts:
  - deuzi says: So, for every font you need to use on your game, you have to declare a 'font-face'.
  - deuzi says: And then list them on your GUI file.
  - show deuzi: happy
  - deuzi says: You can find free fonts to use on sites like Google Fonts!
  - show deuzi: normal
  - hide lessonGUI:
  - deuzi says: Next thing is images.
  - show lessonGUIImages:
  - deuzi says: Here we list the images we will use with their file names.
  - deuzi says: Pay attention to the tag names, they are important.
  - deuzi says: "'mainBackground' will be the background of the main menu."
  - deuzi says: "'settingsBackground' will be the background of the settings menu."
  - deuzi says: "'sliderFull' will be the image used to show the a slider all full, in the settings menu."
  - deuzi says: You can check how those look if you open the settings menu right now and change some of the values.
  - deuzi says: "'messageBox' is the box where dialogue and text will appear. It's where this text is showing right now."
  - deuzi says: And 'nameBox' is the little box where the character's name is displayed. Right now it says Deuzilene.
  - deuzi says: "'ctc' means click to continue, and it's the little image that blinks when the story is waiting for you to click."
  - deuzi says: Your gui could have no nameBox and no ctc, but you definitely need the rest.
  - hide lessonGUIImages:
  - show lessonGUISpritesheets:
  - deuzi says: Next you load the spritesheets.
  - deuzi says: A spritesheet is an image that contains different frames of the same image.
  - deuzi says: That's why after the file, you need to add the width and height of the frame.
  - deuzi says: This is particularly useful to load animations and buttons.
  - deuzi says: So let's see what spritesheets we have.
  - deuzi says: And what images we have.
  - deuzi says: A bunch of buttons! Start, load, save, settings and return button from the main and settings menu.
  - deuzi says: Then the quick menu buttons. The quick menu refers to this little menu we have in the corner.
  - deuzi says: It let's you autoplay, skip play, save and open the settings menu. So we need a button for each of those.
  - deuzi says: Then we have the choice box.
  - deuzi says: And the interrupt box.
  - deuzi says: If you open the interrupt box image, you'll notice it has 4 frames.
  - deuzi says: The first two are for the normal interrupt. 
  - deuzi says: And the last two are for an interrupt that's just about to disappear.
  - deuzi says: It should look more urgent.
  - hide lessonGUISpritesheets:
  - deuzi says: The last kind of asset to declare is audio.
  - show lessonGUIAudio:
  - deuzi says: The only thing we load here is the main menu music.
  - hide lessonGUIAudio:
  - deuzi says: After loading all of the assets, we need to configure how each part of the gui looks.
  - deuzi says: Where the buttons are located, where the text should go, etc.
  - deuzi says: We start with the HUD, the head-up display.
  - deuzi says: That's all the GUI parts we'll use during the story.
  - show lessonGUIHUD:
  - deuzi says: First thing inside 'hud' is the area.
  - deuzi says: The area of the hud is where your quick menu buttons are.
  - deuzi says: It's a rectangle that envelops them, it doesn't have to be perfect.
  - deuzi says: You could have many rectangles if the buttons are no all together.
  - deuzi says: This area is important because it will tell the game that a 'click' inside them doesn't count as a 'story click'.
  - deuzi says: A story click being a click to make the story advance, for example, when the game is waiting for you to read a text.
  - deuzi says: We can not define the area, but then, whenever the player clicks on a button, the story will advance too.
  - deuzi says: That could bring unexpected problems.
  - deuzi says: So it's better to just check where your hud buttons are and make a rectangle around them to define as hud area.
  - deuzi says: After the area we have the 'message' tag.
  - deuzi says: That's the box where all the story text will be displayed.
  - deuzi says: By convention, it will use the 'messageBox' asset.
  - deuzi says: But we need to tell it where to locate it.
  - deuzi says: And then, inside it, where the text will be located, and how it will look.
  - hide lessonGUIHUD:
  - show lessonGUIHUDcont:
  - deuzi says: Then we have the name box. Same as before, you add position and text style.
  - deuzi says: One important thing to notice here is the position must be relative the message box.
  - deuzi says: The ctc doesn't have any text, but it can be animated or not.
  - deuzi says: If it's not animated, then it will be made to blink programatically.
  - deuzi says: But it can be if instead of it being a static image, you load it as a spritesheet.
  - deuzi says: In that case, you should set the 'animated' parameter to true.
  - deuzi says: The ctc's position is also relative to the message box.
  - hide lessonGUIHUDcont:
  - show lessonGUIHUDcont2:
  - deuzi says: Next elements on the 'hud' are the choice and interrupt boxes.
  - deuzi says: You can give them a position, like the rest of the elements.
  - deuzi says: But if you don't, these boxes will be located in the middle of the screen.
  - deuzi says: You can see how that looks on the choices of this story.
  - deuzi says: If you set a position, then the list of choices will be added from that point down.
  - deuzi says: The 'separation' in the choice means how far one box will be from the other.
  - deuzi says: This number should be bigger than the box height itself, or else one box will be on top of the other.
  - deuzi says: Last thing is text style.
  - deuzi says: You can choose a different font for the interrupt.
  - hide lessonGUIHUDcont2:
  - deuzi says: If you want to know more about text styles, you can find information about them in the Phaser documentation.
  - deuzi says: Now, the last elements on the 'hud' are the buttons for the quick menu.
  - show lessonGUIHUDcont3:
  - deuzi says: The tag name for each button is very important, since it's what will determine their action when you press them.
  - deuzi says: The available buttons we have are 'auto', 'skip', 'save' and 'settings'.
  - deuzi says: You don't need all of them in your GUI, of course. You can have only the buttons you deem necessary.
  - hide lessonGUIHUDcont3:
  - deuzi says: And that's all you need to create your 'hud'.
  - deuzi says: But the GUI also has menus.
  - deuzi says: A menu is basically a background with buttons on it. It can have music, and it can have other elements like sliders.
  - deuzi says: Let's see how to do it.
  - show lessonGUIMenu:
  - deuzi says: The first menu we have is 'main'. That's the main menu. As a convention, it will use the background 'mainMenu'.
  - deuzi says: It has music, so we have to indicate what music tag it is we should reproduce.
  - deuzi says: And then it has buttons.
  - deuzi says: The buttons are configured in the same way as before.
  - deuzi says: A meaningful tag, a position and a sprite.
  - hide lessonGUIMenu:
  - show lessonGUISliders:
  - deuzi says: The settings menu is very similar to the main menu, but it has sliders.
  - deuzi says: The sliders, just like the buttons, have a meaningful name.
  - deuzi says: The name indicates what property will be modified by that slider.
  - deuzi says: Then a position, and the sprite of the slider when it's full.
  - hide lessonGUISliders:
  - deuzi says: Wow, that was longer than expected.
